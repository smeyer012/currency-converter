# The Currency Converter - an extension of Currency Data

## Purpose

This is a project designed to showcase my ability to create a simple web application using HTML, CSS and Javascript. It utilizes two API's to compile currency names, symbols and exchange rates and combines them to build select drop downs and number inputs.

## Requirements

This app will:
- load data from an external source (API)
- display items in a select tag
- provide the ability for the user to get currency exchange data by selecting two differenct currencies and amounts
- not produce any errors
- be formatted according to ESLint rules
- be deployed to a publicly accessible platform
- work in Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, and Internet Explorer 11
